# May need some extra fixing-up, but it takes in a inital value to set "i" to, it takes a terminating statement (integer), it takes a value to add to "i", (for example passing in the int 1 is the same as saying i++ in a traditional for loop, and passing in (-1) is i--.
# And it also takes a function to run. Not sure if I got the syntax right, but thats pretty much a for loop.
